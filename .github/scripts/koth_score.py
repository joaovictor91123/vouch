"""Paired champion-vs-challenger scoring for the koth ladder.

Runs vouchbench twice per seed — once with the reigning kit, once with the
challenger kit — over seeds derived from the base sha and the utc date, and
applies the dethrone test from docs/vouchbench-seasons.md:

    dethroned  iff  mean(challenger - champion)  >=  max(0.007, 1.96 x SE)

where SE is the standard error of the per-seed paired differences (common
random numbers: both arms see identical generated sessions per seed, so the
difference cancels seed-to-seed variance).

Seeds are deterministic for a given (base sha, utc day): anyone can recompute
the day's seeds and reproduce the run locally. Same-day overfitting to known
seeds is bounded by the margin band and settled monthly by the season's
commit-reveal scored run, which uses seeds that do not exist until the
cutoff.

Usage:
    python koth_score.py --champion kit.yaml --challenger kit-pr.yaml \
        --base-sha <sha> [--date YYYY-MM-DD] [--out report.json]

Exit code 0 = dethroned (challenger wins), 3 = held (champion stands),
1 = error. The distinct win/hold codes let the workflow branch without
parsing the report.
