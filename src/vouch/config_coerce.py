"""Shared config-boolean coercion.

`bool(x)` on an arbitrary config value is a trap: `yaml.safe_load` resolves
an *unquoted* `true`/`false` to a real Python bool, but a mistakenly-quoted
`"false"` in config.yaml stays a non-empty string, and `bool("false")` is
True. A dozen `load_config()` functions across this codebase each read a
boolean flag out of raw YAML; before this module they either repeated the
same `bool(raw.get(...))` bug (compile.py's `two_phase`, and the `enabled`
flag in session_split/admission/inbox/recall/capture/volunteer_context) or
raised hard on a bad value (install_adapter.py's install.yaml flags, which
is the right call for a one-time CLI install but not for config read on
every session/render).

`coerce_bool()` is the fail-soft half of that spectrum: recognized string
spellings are parsed case-insensitively, anything else (wrong type, typo,
unrecognized spelling) degrades to the caller's default rather than taking
down every caller on a config mistake -- the same fail-soft posture
compile.py's own `_coerce()` already documents for its numeric fields.
