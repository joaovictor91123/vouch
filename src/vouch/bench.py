"""VouchBench: a seeded, judge-free memory benchmark over the real pipeline.

The measurement layer the competitive plan rests on ("better" is a table, not
an adjective). Design follows the strongest ideas in DittoBench, scaled to a
local, LLM-free harness:

* **Seeded generation.** A dataset is a pure function of its seed: coined
  values (never guessable by grep luck), a decoy person holding same-attribute
  facts with different values, knowledge updates where only the latest value
  is correct, a stored-instruction injection note, and cross-person abstention
  probes. Regenerating with a fresh seed is the anti-overfit story — there is
  no dataset file to memorize.
* **Judge-free grading.** A case is graded by substring checks against a typed
  answer key: the expected value must surface in the retrieved context pack,
  and surfacing a forbidden value (a decoy, a superseded value) zeroes the
  case. The dump-guard property is deliberate: stuffing the whole KB into the
  pack fails the decoy and abstention categories, so the only way to score is
  to *rank well under a budget*.
* **The real pipeline, not a stand-in.** The runner builds a throwaway KB,
  ingests each generated session through ``extract.ingest_source`` (the same
  receipt-gated capture loop production uses, with the receipt gate opted in),
  rebuilds the index, and retrieves through ``context.build_context_pack``.
  A score means vouch-as-shipped retrieved it, under the same review-gate
  invariants as always.
* **Verifiability axes.** Three categories grade the store's receipts and
  lifecycle state, not the pack text: citation-correctness (the surfaced
  answer must be spelled by a quote whose byte-offset receipt verifies),
  receipt-coverage (fraction of surfaced claim items carrying a verifying
  receipt), and supersede-hygiene (once an update landed, the stale value
  must not survive as a live claim). Recall-only engines cannot score here
  by construction — the axis receipts make measurable. The shared-contract
  half of a head-to-head lives in ``memory_contract.MemoryContract``, the
  five-tool (Ditto-contract) adapter over the same store.

No model, no network, no wall-clock dependence: `vouch bench run --seed 7`
gives the same number on every machine, which is what makes scores comparable
across contributors (the GitHub-competition property).

Reference baseline (update when retrieval changes; the levers are the zeros):

======================  =====================================================
run                     ``vouch bench run --seeds 1,2,3,4,5,6`` @ 2026-07-28
composite               0.52 ± 0.03 (SE)
single-session-recall   1.00   — verbatim receipts + FTS: plain recall is won
multi-session           0.50
knowledge-update        0.00   — superseded value stays in the pack; needs
                                 lifecycle-driven supersession, not reranking
                                 (recency reorders, dump-guard still zeroes)
point-in-time           0.83
decoy-discrimination    0.00   — same-attribute other-person value outranks
injection-resistance    0.83
abstention              0.00   — cross-person leak under lexical match
citation-correctness    1.00   — guard: the surfaced answer is receipt-quoted
receipt-coverage        1.00   — guard: surfaced claims are receipt-backed
supersede-hygiene       0.00   — stale value stays live; the lifecycle lever
                                 (same root cause as knowledge-update's zero)
======================  =====================================================

For calibration only (different benchmarks, not directly comparable):
ditto's stock production-mirroring harness reports memory_mean 0.200-0.226
on its own v5/v6 contracts, with 0.00 on its consolidation/multi-hop
classes and 0.04 on stored-instruction injection.
