"""Per-artifact effectiveness: is this claim earning its keep? (#426)

``eval/recall.py`` scores whether the right artifact *can* be retrieved. This
scores the layer above it: given that an artifact was surfaced into a session,
how did that session end? A claim can be perfectly retrievable and still be
dead weight, or actively misleading, and today a reviewer deciding what to
expire has nothing to go on.

The association is built from two things already on disk:

* ``retrieval_events`` — the append-only log of what each context pack
  contained. This is the surfacing record; no new table is introduced. The
  issue proposed a derived ``index_db`` table, but that would be a second
  copy of data this log already holds, and a parallel data path is the one
  thing the architecture rules out.
* ``audit.read_events`` — the authoritative mutation stream, which is what
  classifies a session's outcome.

Sessions, not artifacts, carry the outcome: ``Session.started_at`` /
``ended_at`` bound a window, every audit event inside it votes, and every
artifact surfaced inside it inherits the verdict. Classifying sessions rather
than artifacts also avoids a trap — ``claim.supersede`` records
``[old, new, relation]``, so per-artifact attribution would score the winning
claim as a bad outcome alongside the one it replaced.

Read-only and measurement-only: nothing here writes an artifact, an audit
event, or a proposal, and a bad verdict never expires anything. The human at
the gate decides; this only ranks what to look at.

Honesty about what this is: an *associational* signal, not a causal one. An
artifact surfaced into sessions that went badly may be the cause, a symptom,
or a bystander. That is why verdicts are power-gated — ``useful`` and
``harmful`` are withheld until a 95% Wilson interval clears the corpus
baseline and the sample meets ``min_samples``, and everything else reports
``unverified`` or ``insufficient`` rather than a confident number.
